Dear all,

When you start creating a page, please use my header and footer HTML DOM I defined in contact.html and use
style.css along with it.
You can then code the main body part of your page, and you should define a specific CSS styles for that main part of yours.

For example, for my contact.html, I use style.css to define header and footer styles. Later, I created contact.css to
define the specific style for the main part of contact.html.
